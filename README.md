# Project 2 - Crowdfunding Data Analysis

## Description

In this project, our group practiced building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Pythons' JSON library to extract and transform crowdfunding data. After we transformed the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV files to create an ERD and table schema. Lastly, we created a database in PostgreSQL that housed the four tables based on our schema and imported the CSV data to the tables.

## Group Contributions

We completed the data analysis in Python and the work we did in PostgreSQL as a group. While in a group, one person shared their screen and worked on the project while the others helped by sharing thoughts and ideas or looked up things as necessary.
